 This install applies to "Zine #11" 1991 Brainstorm.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path.
 It can be found in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed diskmag requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem
 (+1.0 MB OtherMem for preload and Kickstart ROM)
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 Features:
 ---------
 - Full load from HD
 - DMA wait in replayer fixed (x4)
 - Illegal copperlist entries fixed (uninitialised COPJMP registers)
 - Intro can be skipped with CUSTOM1
 - NewIcon (created by me)
 - Source code included as usual
 - Quit option that works on 68000 machines (default key is 'F10')

 And here's the patch for the last Zine issue on Amiga ever.
 Completely new code by Chaos/Sanity (or Farbrausch nowadays) and
 excellent handling. Since there are quite a few system calls this
 patch requires a Kickstart ROM, I might update it later to work
 without one but do not count on it!

 Since the code is really nice there only was the replayer and a minor
 copperlist problem to fix.

 If you want to enjoy some hidden messages from Orlando load the "Pic!"
 binary into your favorite hex editor. :)

 Enjoy this last Zine issue, good content and a great tune by Axel
 make this one a nice read!

 Special greetings to Axel/Brainstorm :)
